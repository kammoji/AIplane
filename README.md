General Artificial Intelligence

"Keep in mind that in order to build flying machines, we donâ€™t build airplanes that flap their wings, or that are made of bones, muscle, and feather." -Hitherto unknown author.

Derive from this thought the happiest thought of my small life:

"In order to build Artificial Intelligence that simulates human brain, we DON'T write programs that parallel process electrical pulses through dendrites, axons and synapses."

Stay tuned...
